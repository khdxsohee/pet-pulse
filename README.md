## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is purely front-end and does not require any server or complex setup to run on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khdxsohee/pet-pulse.git
    ```
    ```
    https://github.com/khdxsohee/pet-pulse.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd pet-pulse-main
    ```
3.  **View the Website:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can simply double-click the file, or type `file:///path/to/pet-pulse/index.html` in your browser's address bar.

## 💡 How to Use the Theme Toggle

In the website's header, there is a button with a "palette" icon (`<i class="fas fa-palette"></i>`). Clicking this button will cycle the UI theme through:

`Dark Theme` &rarr; `Light Theme` &rarr; `Red Theme` &rarr; `Green Theme` &rarr; `Yellow Theme` &rarr; `Pink Theme` &rarr; `Chocolate Theme` &rarr; `Dark Theme` (and so on).

Your theme preference will be saved in Local Storage, so when you revisit the website, it will remember your last chosen theme.
